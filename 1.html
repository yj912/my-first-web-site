Little distinguishes the exterior of artist Mickalene Thomas’s Brooklyn studio from the surrounding businesses and buildings. Her workspace is on an unremarkable street in the Fort Greene area, and its entryway is partially obscured by a block-long matrix of scaffolding as well as a truck delivering fittings for a neighborhood gym preparing for its grand opening. There’s only a discreet posting near her building’s buzzer to indicate that behind these industrial doors lies a magical, kaleidoscopic world of paint, paper and paillettes depicting Black women in repose, Black women indulging in the luxury of self-assurance, Black women existing in a world of their own creation. <br>Thomas, 51, has built her substantial art-world reputation by focusing on Black women and presenting them not as uniquely heroic or long-suffering, not as tools for cultural propaganda, but as self-affirming, sensual beings. Thomas hints at their complicated and layered identities with her use of collage; she heightens their beauty and glamour by incorporating crystals and rhinestones; she underscores their power with an aesthetic pulled from the “Black is beautiful” era of the 1970s. Thomas’s women often look as though they have stepped from a blaxploitation film, the pages of Ebony or Jet magazines, or the imagination of someone who keenly understands the importance of celebrating your own fabulousness when the world is stubbornly blind to it.<p><p style="margin-top:40px">“We, too, can recline,” Thomas declares.
